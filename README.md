**README for Super Sudoku Solver, Call to Order and The Infinite Monkey Theorem Projects**

**Project 1: Super Sudoku Solver**

**Overview:**
The "Super Sudoku Solver" project focuses on implementing a program capable of solving any given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It provides hands-on experience with linear structures, particularly stacks, two-dimensional arrays, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques.

**Specifications:**
The project comprises four classes:
1. **SudokuPuzzle:** Represents a configuration of a Sudoku puzzle, including starting, solved, or intermediate configurations.
2. **SudokuSolver:** An object that represents an "expert" capable of solving a given SudokuPuzzle using backtracking.
3. **SudokuMove:** Represents a single digit placement while solving a Sudoku puzzle.
4. **SudokuTest:** The main program responsible for reading puzzle files, solving puzzles, and verifying solutions.

**Implementation:**
- **SudokuPuzzle:** Implements methods to interact with the puzzle grid stored as a two-dimensional array.
- **SudokuSolver:** Utilizes backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently, determining valid moves to make.
- **SudokuMove:** Represents digit placements in the Sudoku grid.
- **SudokuTest:** Handles user input, puzzle solving, and solution verification.

**Testing:**
The functionality of solving Sudoku puzzles and verifying solutions can be tested by running the main method in SudokuTest, which includes test cases for various puzzle scenarios and solution validations.

**Note:**
The project offers an opportunity to explore algorithmic problem-solving techniques in the context of solving Sudoku puzzles. The README provides a brief overview of the project's objectives, implementation details, and testing strategies to guide users in understanding and utilizing the provided code effectively.


**Project 2: Call to Order**

**Overview:**
The "Call to Order" project is focused on extending an ArrayList-like class to support sorting, specifically tailored for managing Bowdoin College student directory information. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with inheritance, interfaces, String methods, comparators, and generics, along with exploring the implementation of inner classes.

**Specifications:**
The project involves creating three classes:
1. **SortableArrayList:** A class supporting sorting, extending from a SimpleArrayList class, provided but not to be modified.
2. **Student:** Represents a single studentâ€™s information read from a Bowdoin College directory file.
3. **DirectorySort:** Acts as a holder for the main method and any helper methods, responsible for reading the directory file, constructing a list of Student objects, and sorting it based on various criteria.

**Implementation:**
- **SortableArrayList:** Inherits from SimpleArrayList and implements sorting methods using selection sort algorithm.
- **Student:** Represents student information parsed from the directory file.
- **DirectorySort:** Utilizes SortableArrayList to sort Student objects based on various criteria, including SU box, last name, vowels in the name, and occurrences of a digit in the phone number.

**Testing:**
The functionality of sorting and directory analysis can be tested by running the main method in DirectorySort, which includes test cases for various sorting criteria.


**Project 3: The Infinite Monkey Theorem**

**Overview:**
The "Infinite Monkey Theorem" project simulates a "somewhat clever" monkey attempting to write text resembling works of famous authors by mimicking patterns observed in sample texts. The algorithm used involves analyzing character probability distributions to generate random text that resembles the input text.

**Implementation:**
The implementation involves analyzing input text files to determine character probability distributions at different levels (up to a specified depth). The program then generates random text by selecting characters based on the observed probabilities.

**Specifications:**
- Prompt the user to enter the name of an input file and the desired depth of analysis (k).
- Analyze the input text to determine character probability distributions at the specified depth.
- Generate random text following the observed probabilities.
- Output 500 characters of randomly generated text based on the input analysis.

**Testing:**
The program can be tested by providing input text files of various lengths and complexities to observe how accurately the generated text resembles the original. Additionally, testing can ensure proper functionality of file I/O and error handling for invalid inputs.

**Note:**
All three projects offered valuable opportunities for me to practice core Java concepts and algorithms while addressing specific problem domains through my Data Structures course. The README provides a brief overview of each project's objectives, implementation details, and testing strategies to guide users in understanding and utilizing the provided code effectively.
